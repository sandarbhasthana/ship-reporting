Tab 1

This platform is designed to assign, track and close deficiencies/ observations during ship inspections and to keep an auditable record of actions taken

The platform will have 2 user groups-
1. Vessel (1 user for 1 ship)
2. Office ( multiple users. Vessel mapping to be decided)

The information will be recorded through ‘inspection reports’

Vessel can create a new inspection report, name it and add observations to it.

An Inspection report will have following parameters and can have up to 100 entries 

1. Sr. No- this is alphanumeric including ‘.’ and limit of 5 chars. Manually entered
2. Deficiency- free text upto 1000 chars
3. Master’s cause analysis- free text upto 1000 chars
4. Corrective action - free text upto 1000 chars
5. Preventive action - free text upto 1000 chars
6. Complete date- date 
7. Company analysis - free text upto 1000 chars
8. Remarks- this has 3 parts-
a. Status ( Choice of ‘ Closed satisfactorily’, ‘Further action needed’)
b. Sign (auto populated from login Id)
c. Date- entered by company

1st 6 parameters can be added and edited by vessel. Office has edit rights to same
Parameters 7 and 8 can be added only by office

Project plan analysis
Strengths:
● Clear user roles and permissions
● Well-defined data model
● Audit trail requirement
● Field-level edit permissions
Considerations:
● Vessel-to-office mapping logic
● Offline support (vessels may have limited connectivity)
● Report versioning/history
● Notifications/alerts for status changes
● Bulk operations for 100-entry reports
● Export/reporting capabilities
Recommended architecture
1. Frontend (web application)
Tech stack:
● Next.js 14+ (App Router) with TypeScript
● React Server Components
● Server-side rendering
● API routes
● Built-in authentication helpers
● UI:
● Tailwind CSS
● shadcn/ui
● React Hook Form + Zod
● TanStack Table

2. Backend
Tech stack:
● Next.js API routes (simple) or separate API service
● Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
● Type safety
● Migrations
● Audit logging support
● Authentication: NextAuth.js (Auth.js)
● Role-based access control (RBAC)
● Session management
3. Additional services
● Audit logging: Custom middleware logging all actions
● File storage: AWS S3 / Azure Blob (if attachments needed later)
● Real-time: Server-Sent Events or WebSockets (optional)
